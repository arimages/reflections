What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a space to place files in order to track them and the changes to them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to place the files from the working directory before commit the changes and view any differences between the staged document and the commit document. The repository includes the staging area, working directory and commit files.
